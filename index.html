       <h2>Early Life</h2>
       <p>Born in Shinjō, Yamagata, Togashi began drawing manga casually in his first to second year of elementary school.[1][2][3] In high school, Togashi joined the fine-arts club; he later enrolled at Yamagata University where he studied education in the hope of becoming a teacher.[1] During college he submitted some of his manga work to Weekly Young Jump, published by Shueisha.[1][2] In 1986, at age 20, he authored a manga titled Buttobi Straight (ぶっとびストレート Buttobi Sutorēto) for which he received the Tezuka Award, the most prestigious award for new comic artists in Japan.[3][4][5] Another manga by Togashi titled Jura no Mizuki (ジュラのミヅキ) was an honorable mention in Shueisha's first annual Hop Step Award Selection magazine, published in 1988.[6] After having given up his goal of becoming a teacher, Togashi was contacted by an editor of Weekly Shōnen Jump during his senior year of college, who asked him to move to Tokyo.[2]</p>
